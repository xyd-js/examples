# About the API reference
:::subtitle
A comprehensive reference of all objects, queries, and mutations supported by the platform API
:::

This GraphQL API reference contains documentation for our GraphQL API schema. It is divided into two reference categories:

:::grid{cols=2}
- 
  - 
    :::guide-card{title="Books API Reference" href="/docs/api/books-api/introduction"}
    Manage books and authors with powerful endpoints for library management
    :::

  - 
    :::guide-card{title="Todos API Reference" href="/docs/api/todos-api/introduction"}
    Manage tasks and todo items using APIs for task management
    :::
:::

Object types are divided into individual documents within the two categories. Each document explains the object, supported queries and mutations, and their corresponding fields and arguments.

The documents are in the left-side menu. There, you will also find a column types reference that walks through each supported column type and its functionality.

All other utility types and enums are listed in a separate document within their respective categories:
* Books API reference other types
* Todos API reference other types
