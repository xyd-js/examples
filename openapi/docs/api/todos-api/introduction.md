# About the Todos API reference
:::subtitle
A comprehensive reference of all objects, queries, and mutations supported by the Todos API
:::

The Todos API reference contains documentation for our OpenAPI schema focused on book and author management. It provides endpoints for:

:::grid{cols=2}
- 
  - 
    :::guide-card{title="Book Management" href="/docs/api/todos-api/addBook"}
    Create, read, update, and delete todos with comprehensive metadata
    :::

  - 
    :::guide-card{title="Author Management" href="/docs/api/todos-api/addAuthor"}
    Manage author information and their relationships with todos
    :::
:::

Object types are divided into individual documents within the Todos API category. Each document explains the object, supported queries and mutations, and their corresponding fields and arguments.

The documents are listed in the left-side menu. There, you will also find a column types reference that walks through each supported column type and its functionality.

All other utility types and enums are listed in a separate document within the Todos API category:
